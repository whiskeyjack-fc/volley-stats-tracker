# PlayerStats — Volleyball Stat Tracker

A web-based volleyball statistics tracking application built with Flask and SQLite. Track player performance during matches, review per-set and per-match reports, and analyse season-level trends with interactive charts.

## Features

- **Live tracking grid** — players as rows, stat categories as columns; click to increment, long-press to decrement
- **Stat categories** — Serve (error, 1–3, ace), Attack (kill, error), Receive (error, 1–3, overpass), Block (kill, error), Freeball (error, 1–3), Fault
- **Per-set tracking** — track sets independently, mark sets as Main or Reserve, finish and reopen sets
- **Derived stats** — total attempts, raw result, fault %, and quality score (Serve / Receive / Freeball)
- **Match reports** — filterable by set type (Main / Reserve) or individual set; interactive Chart.js charts
- **Season reports** — aggregate stats across all matches in a season
- **Game management** — create, edit, and delete matches
- **Multi-trainer support** — each trainer has their own account; data is fully isolated per user
- **Role-based access** — three roles: `trainer` (own data only), `coordinator` (read all data), `admin` (read all data + manage user roles)
- **Admin panel** — admins can view all registered users and assign or change roles at `/admin/users`

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Flask 3.x
- Flask-Login 0.6+
- Gunicorn 21+ (production only)

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Starting the Server (development)

```bash
cd c:\git\PlayerStats
python app.py
```

The development server starts at **http://127.0.0.1:5000**.

Flask's auto-reloader is enabled by default, so the server restarts automatically whenever `app.py` or a template is saved.

## Deploying to PythonAnywhere (free hosting)

1. Create a free account at [pythonanywhere.com](https://www.pythonanywhere.com).
2. Open a **Bash console** and clone/upload the repo.
3. Create a virtualenv and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   mkvirtualenv --python=python3.12 volleystats
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. In the **Web** tab, create a new web app (Manual configuration, Python 3.12).
5. Edit the **WSGI configuration file** — replace its contents with:
   ```python
   import sys
   sys.path.insert(0, '/home/<your-username>/PlayerStats')
   from app import app as application
   ```
6. In the **Web** tab → **Environment variables**, add:
   ```
   SECRET_KEY=<a long random string>
   ```
7. Click **Reload** — the app is live at `<your-username>.pythonanywhere.com`.

> **Note:** PythonAnywhere's free tier stores your SQLite database on persistent disk, so no database migration is needed.

## Updating the App on PythonAnywhere

Deployments are fully automated via a Copilot agent prompt — including the git push.

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the project root and fill in your PythonAnywhere credentials (one-time setup):
   ```
   PA_API_TOKEN=your_api_token_here
   PA_USERNAME=your_username_here
   PA_DOMAIN=your_username.pythonanywhere.com
   ```
   Generate your API token at **pythonanywhere.com → Account → API token**.

2. In VS Code Copilot Chat, run the deploy prompt:
   - Open the prompt picker and select **deploy** (`.github/prompts/deploy.prompt.md`)

   The agent will:
   - Commit and push any uncommitted local changes to `main`
   - Create a temporary console on PythonAnywhere
   - Run `deploy.sh` on the server (`git pull`, and `pip install` only if `requirements.txt` changed)
   - Poll until the script completes
   - Reload the web app automatically
   - Report the outcome

> **CPU seconds:** A routine deploy (no dependency changes) costs ~1–2 CPU seconds against PythonAnywhere's free tier limit of 100/day.

> **Database migrations:** If `app.py` adds new tables or columns, they are applied automatically the next time the app starts (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` pattern). No manual migration step is needed unless a column is renamed or dropped.

### First-time server setup
Before using the deploy prompt for the first time, run these commands once in a PythonAnywhere Bash console to make the deploy script executable:
```bash
cd ~/PlayerStats
chmod +x deploy.sh
```

## Usage

1. Open **http://127.0.0.1:5000** in your browser.
2. Click **New Game** to create a match (enter opponent name, date, season, team name).
3. Click **Track** to open the live tracking grid for that match.
4. Use the set bar at the top to manage sets — add new sets, assign a type (Main / Reserve), and finish them when done.
5. Click a cell to record a stat; long-press (≥ 600 ms) to remove one.
6. Click **Report** to view the match report with stat tables and charts.
7. Use the filter bar at the top of the report to switch between All, Main, Reserve, or individual sets.
8. Navigate to **Seasons** from the home page for an aggregated season view.

## Database

The SQLite database (`stats.db`) is created automatically in the project root on first run. It contains the following tables:

| Table               | Description                                      |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `users`             | Trainer accounts (email, hashed password, role)  |
| `games`             | One row per match (scoped to a user)             |
| `players`           | Players registered per match                     |
| `sets`              | Sets within a match (type, finished flag)        |
| `events`            | Individual stat events (stat + result)           |
| `seasons`           | Named seasons (scoped to a user)                 |
| `club_teams`        | Club roster definitions (scoped to a user)       |
| `club_team_players` | Players belonging to a club team                 |
